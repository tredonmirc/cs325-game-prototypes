<h2>Friday Night</h2>


<ul>
  <li><strong>Iteration updates:</strong>
    This the first and second iteration, so this includes all updates.  Custom tilemap of 48px units provides for perfect character movement with no collision "snags" like the first game.  
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
  Originality points for a boardgame structure in Phaser, where scrollers are the norm - this one is a complete evolution over the first attempt with no collision issues.  Original Tilemap created with Tiled and Imported via json - complete alteration to the last with MUCH larger sets and attention to details.  Unique swap mechanic to add complexity to the board game and goal attainment.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Tilemap generated in Tiled</li>
  <li>Permissible movement tiles comes from map array</li>
  <li>Point array to register updates to the character</li>
  <li>Swapping of characters</li>
  <li>"RISK" tile point allows some randomness in point attainment</li>
  <li>Movement and tile sounds, background music</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
  <li>Things learned</li>
  <ul>
    <li>How to make a tilemap with much larger tiles and to use more complex bitmaps</li>
    <li>How to create a permissible movement array to emulate collisions with static x,y updates</li>
    <li>How to swap sprites with x,y updates</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Easiest or hardest thing</li>
  <ul>
    <li> This game has been a challenge for several reasons.  The first rose from my attempt to create a tilemap based board game that had better movement than the first (Dog Walker) game.  This let me down the path of implementing movement with static x,y updates (instead of "velocity" type movements).  ALthough this provides exact movement it prevents the use of collision because the sprits are "moving" into others but effectively teleport.  This was solved by laboriously mapping each tile location to an array and marking which are valid tiles for movement.  Another issue I encountered was swapping sprite locations based on the tile locations.  Though the location swap was pretty straightforward, gaurding the process to only occur once in a move took some ingenuity.</li>
    <li>Another challenge IS (some race cases seems to plaque the gameplay) ensuring accurate teleportation - occasions occur where the event doesn't trigger :(</li>
    <li>Applying sounds to movement is REALLY easy in Phaser</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
  Although I did watch a couple tutorials, I did not base my protoype on any other Phaser template - this took a while to hash out piece by piece.
  The message box code was pulled from "https://phasergames.com/adding-message-box-phaser-games/"
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
  You're a dog walker - meet the dogs needs and return a hero or lost the "business" forever!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
  The concept for this game was derived from real life and aims to model challenges dog walkers face.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>Input: Keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: Swapping is decided by opponenets - RISK tiles offer bonus points at player risk</li>
<li>Genre: Roleplaying,  Life simulation</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
  The mechanic this prototype is evaluating is how best to model real life events.  Specifically, its attempting to model turn-based playstyle in non turn-based movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
  Players will hopefully enjoy the analogies of a Friday School Night. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
  <p>
    The concept of this game is simple.  You are a student, and Friday Night has finally come.  You have options tonight - you can either Party (the pink path and score tiles), Work (the green path and score tiles) or study (the blue path and score tiles).

    You gain points but landing on score or Risk tiles.  The score tiles will always give points, and the more you get in a specific type, the more points it awards.  Think of it like added gains by "focusing" on a particular task.  You will get, 1, then 2, then 4 and 8 points for each type of score tile you land on. RISK tiles give you a chance at obtaining points from paths other than the one you're on BUT they run a risk.  If you roll a 1-2 on a 1d6, you get BONUS points, but 3-6 will subtract points!!! 

    SWAP tiles let you be crafty and switch positions with the other player.  Once a player uses a SWAP tile they cannot use it again.  

    The first person to finish will terminate the game and the current points will determine who wins!
  </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
  <p>Players will have to determine which path to persue, forcing some strategy with SWAPs and randomness with high risk, high rewards in the RISK tiles</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
  Simple backstory - one all students are familiar with: balancing social, financial, and school obligations.  THis one has the twist of pitting your will (or wit) agains an opponent.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
  None/All.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
  Variable.  < 30 seconds to 5+ minutes
</li>

</ul>
