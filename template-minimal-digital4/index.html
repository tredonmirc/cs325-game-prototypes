<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    Planetary defense from ICE asteroids with shields instead of a ship fighting asteroids
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    This has custom made (planet/shield) sprites that overlap
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? Was getting the two sprites (shield and planet) to work well together  What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? Easiest was not having to grab new files for this iteration
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/asteroids-movement for the shooting mechanics
    The core concept exists, I'm sure I've played something like it but I couldn't tell you the name of it - this was pulled from memory/imagination mostly
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Defend your planet against the icy asteroid or die trying.  Use the shields to mitigate planetary damage.  Use them sparingly to recharge
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
Ice
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    Collisions, sprite animation, music, sound, direction, playability
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    Just want folks to have some mindless fun
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    Gameplay is simple - fire your planet blasters at the incoming chickens to elminate them
    Left & Right arrow keys to turn your planet and space to fire your blasters
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    A little bit of preemptive thinking and planning with a bit of luck
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    Planet Fire is the hottest place in  world in the SVGA universe but are constantly under attack from icy meteors.
