<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    Planetary defense with shields instead of a ship fighting asteroids
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    This has custom made (planet/shield) sprites that overlap (it's not working great ATM tho)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? Getting a simple running game to play is time-consuming
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? Hardest was and still is making the environment react - I hope to
    find a better way to do this GameStates soon.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
    Bullets - http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/asteroids-movement
    Chickens - http://angry-mage-games.wdfiles.com/local--files/sprites/%24Chicken.png

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/asteroids-movement for the shooting mechanics
    The core concept exists, I'm sure I've played something like it but I couldn't tell you the name of it - this was pulled from memory/imagination mostly
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Defend your planet against the asteroids or die trying
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
    (Space) Chickens!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    Collisions, sprite animation
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    Just want folks to have some mindless fun
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    Gameplay is simple - fire your planet blasters at the incoming chickens to elminate them
    Left & Right arrow keys to turn your planet and space to fire your blasters
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    A little bit of preemptive thinking and planning with a bit of luck
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    Planet Worm is the most fertile world in the SVGA universe but the hungry space chickens need to eat.
    A matter of life and death, they will not stop until all the worms are consumed - defend your planet!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    Mindless automatons
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
    < 5 minutes
</li>

</ul>
